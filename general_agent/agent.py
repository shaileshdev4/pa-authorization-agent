"""
general_agent — Agent definition.

This agent works without any patient context or FHIR server.
It demonstrates the minimal agent pattern: tools + instruction, no callback.

To customise:
  • Change model, description, and instruction below.
  • Add or remove tools from the tools=[...] list.
  • Write new tool functions in general_agent/tools/general.py.
  • If you later need FHIR access, import extract_fhir_context from shared.fhir_hook
    and add it as before_model_callback, then import FHIR tools from shared.tools.
